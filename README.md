## Pharmacy Management Desktop Application

### Overview

PharmaTech is a company dedicated to the purchase, sale, and distribution of medications, health, and hygiene products for various uses (treatments, diseases, ailments, or daily use). Due to the significant growth in business, PharmaTech has decided to establish 3 pharmacies in 3 cities in the Republic of Mexico. However, due to the recent demand, various problems have arisen in inventory control and management. The main problems include the sale of expired drugs, overselling items that are not available, and confusion among staff in delivering items to customers. To address these issues, PharmaTech requests the creation of software that allows the company to control pharmacy inventory, as well as the acquisition or distribution of items and medications.

### Additional Considerations

- Not all medications are over-the-counter, so it is essential not to sell prescription medications without a valid prescription, and for controlled medications, customers need to present official identification.
- A new promotion should be published each month to attract more customers and increase sales.
- The system should issue an alert for products that are nearing expiration.
